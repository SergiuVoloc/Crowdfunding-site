            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi! Sandip (the founder) here!

                Want to know how and why GoGetFunding started? I’d love to fill you in…</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2011 I saw crowdfunding gaining traction. It was awesome seeing creative
                campaigns come to
                life but it wasn’t so cool that personal causes and projects weren’t allowed on the most popular
                platforms. And I thought the sites that did allow personal fundraising could do a better job, so heck,
                <strong> why not create something better?</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I wanted to create a platform that made it exciting and rewarding to start and be part of a campaign. To
                really capture the crowdfunding buzz and democratize it all – that’s what crowdfunding is all about at
                the end of the day. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> I wanted complete crowdfunding freedom and
                    flexibility!</strong>
            </p>
            <img class="col-xs-12 img-fluid" src="/img/page_About/Flexible-Fundraising.png" alt="img6">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s when GoGetFunding was born!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With a low budget but high ambitions, I launched the site, and then spent all day and much
                of the night letting people know what we could do for them. With a little luck and a lot of hard work,
                we started gaining traction. Within the first 3 months, campaigns on GoGetFunding had raised over
                $20,000!! <strong>The feeling was incredible.</strong> People were actually using the site to do good,
                change lives and make an impact! Fast forward a few months on and people were now raising $20,000 in a
                day! GoGetFunding was catching on.</p>
            <img class="col-xs-12 img-fluid" src="/img/page_About/Original-GoGetFunding-homepage.png" alt="img7">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2012 GoGetFunding continued to grow but the website struggled to keep up. There were
                sleepless nights, and my nerves were almost always on edge as I prepared to jump into action if I saw
                website performance being affected.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed to put together a great team and then reinvested all the money I had into
                GoGetFunding. After almost 5 months of intense web development and design, version 2 of the site was
                launched. I could finally sleep easy and most important of all, we could offer fundraisers and donors
                <strong>the best service</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the early days, GoGetFunding has seen hundreds of improvements and iterations and we
                continue to enhance the website and fundraising experience every single day. From humble beginnings,
                GoGetFunding has now enjoyed millions of visitors, donations and helped thousands of campaigns reach or
                exceed their target.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you become part of the GoGetFunding journey!</p>
